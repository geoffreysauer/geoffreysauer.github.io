138
</h3>
</header>

<p>When my love swears that she is made of truth,<br>
I do believe her, though I know she lies,<br>
That she might think me some untutored youth,<br>
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.<span>4</span></p>

<p>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,<br>
Although she knows my days are past the best,<br>
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,<br>
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:<span>8</span></p>

<p>But wherefore says she not she is unjust?<br>
And wherefore say not I that I am old?<br>
O love's best habit is in seeming trust,<br>
And age in love, loves not to have years told.<span>12</span></p>

<p class="coup">Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,<br>
And in our faults by lies we flattered be.</p>
