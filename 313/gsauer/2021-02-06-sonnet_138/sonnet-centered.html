<h1>Sonnet 138</h1>
<h2>William Shakespeare</h2>

<p>When my love swears that she is made of truth<br>
I do believe her though I know she lies,<br>
That she might think me some untutored youth,<br>
Unlearnèd in the world’s false subtleties.</p>



<p>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,<br>
Although she knows my days are past the best,<br>
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue;<br>
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.</p>



<p>But wherefore says she not she is unjust?<br>
And wherefore say not I that I am old?<br>
O, love’s best habit is in seeming trust,<br>
And age in love loves not to have years told.</p>

<p class="last">Therefore I lie with her and she with me,<br>
And in our faults by lies we flattered be.</p>
