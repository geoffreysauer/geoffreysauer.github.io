<body>
<main>
<p>Mine eye hath play’d the painter and hath stell’d
<br>Thy beauty’s form in table of my heart;
<br>My body is the frame wherein ’tis held,
<br>And perspective it is the painter’s art.</p>
<p>For through the painter must you see his skill,
<br>To find where your true image pictured lies;
<br>Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,
<br>That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.</p>
<p>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
<br>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
<br>Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
<br>Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;</p>
</main>
<p class="coup">Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;
<br>They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
