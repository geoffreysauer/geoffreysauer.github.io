<h1>Sonnet 136</h1>
<h4>By William Shakespeare</h2><hr>
<p>If thy soul check thee that I come so near,<br>
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will,<br>
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;<br>
Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.</p>
<p>Will, will fulfil the treasure of thy love,<br>
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.<br>
In things of great receipt with ease we prove<br>
Among a number one is reckoned none:</p>
<p>Then in the number let me pass untold,<br>
Though in thy store's account I one must be;<br>
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold<br>
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:</p>
<p class="last">Make but my name thy love, and love that still,<br>
And then thou lovest me for my name is 'Will.'</p>
