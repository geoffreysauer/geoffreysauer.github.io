<h1>
Sonnet 77
</h1>
<h2>
By William Shakespeare
</h2>
<hr>
<p>Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,<br>
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;<br>
The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,<br>
And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.<br></p>
<p>
 The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show<br>
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;<br>
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know<br>
Time's thievish progress to eternity.<br>
</p>
<p>
Look what thy memory cannot contain,<br>
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find<br>
Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,<br>
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.<br>
  <p style="margin-left:1%; ">	<i>	These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,</i>	<br>
 		<i>	Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.</i>
