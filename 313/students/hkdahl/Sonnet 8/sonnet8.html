<h1>Sonnet 8</h1> 
<h2>William Shakespeare</h2> 

<p>Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?<br> 
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.<br> 
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,<br> 
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?<span>4</span></p>
 
<p>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<br> 
By unions married, do offend thine ear,<br> 
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<br>
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.<span>8</span></p>
 
<p>Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,<br> 
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,<br>
Resembling sire and child and happy mother<br>
Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing;<span>12</span></p>

<p class="last">Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,<br> 
Sings this to thee: "Thou single wilt prove none."</p>
