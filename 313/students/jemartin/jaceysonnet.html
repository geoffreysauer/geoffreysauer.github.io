	<h1>Sonnet 88</h1>
	
	<h2><em>William Shakespeare</em></h2>
<p>When thou shalt be disposed to set me light<br>
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,<br>
Upon thy side against myself Iâ€™ll fight<br>
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.</p>

<p>With mine own weakness being best acquainted,<br>
Upon thy part I can set down a story<br>
Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted,<br>
That thou, in losing me, shall win much glory;</p>

<p>And I by this will be a gainer too;<br>
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,<br>
The injuries that to myself I do,<br>
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.</p>

<p class="coup">
Such is my love, to thee I so belong,<br>
That, for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.</p>
